# ACMOS_PROJECT: CATEGORY 1

## Overview

In this project we have designed an LDO subject to different conditions. For this design
we are designing the LDO for both externally and internally compensated LDO. We
have considered different technology nodes for the same. For the below figure we are
considering 45nm technology node. The technology node file is attached here.Our aim is
to design the LDO for a max and a min load condition
